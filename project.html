    <h3>About Movie</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Did you know that?
      <ol>
      <li>For the filming of the film, Cameron rented the <abbr title="Manhattan Beach Studios">MBS</abbr> Media Campus set in Southern California for a period of 5 years. Characteristic features of this site are an "aggressive" water conservation program, the use of environmentally friendly cleaning products and paints, as well as a number of other "green" programs. Cameron intends to install solar panels in the studio and shoot both films using solar energy. The cost of installing the appropriate equipment will cost the director &euro; 4.4 million.</li>
      <li>In March 2012, aboard the Deepsea Challenger submersible, James Cameron dived to the bottom of the Mariana Trench to seek inspiration for Pandora's ocean floor and a 3D documentary about the Pacific Trench. Thus, Cameron became the third person in history to undertake such an expedition.</li>
      <li>As James Cameron once stated, writing the sequel to Avatar (2009) was so laborious that he split it between a whole team of writers that included Rick Jaffa and his wife Amanda Silver, Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno.
        <blockquote cite="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/505898/?"> â€œWe met for 7 months and worked on every episode of each film, but who will be doing what continuation, I told them only at the very last moment. I knew that if I sorted them into films earlier, at general meetings they would be mentally turned off as soon as it came to a film that others would have to do."</blockquote></li>
